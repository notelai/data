"HD.HCI.HLOS","","Harmonized Test Scores","","Harmonized Test Scores from major international student achievement testing programs. They are measured in TIMMS-equivalent units, where 300 is minimal attainment and 625 is advanced attainment. Most recent estimates are used. The year of the most recent estimate is shown in the data notes. Test scores from the following testing programs are included: • TIMSS/PIRLS: Refers to the average of test scores from TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) and PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study), both carried out by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Data from each PIRLS round is moved to the year of the nearest TIMSS round and averaged with the TIMSS data. • PISA: Refers to test scores from the Programme for International Student Assessment • PISA+TIMSS/PIRLS: Refers to the average of these programs for countries and years where both are available • SACMEQ: Refers to test scores from the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality • PASEC: Refers to test scores from the Program of Analysis of Education Systems • LLECE: Refers to test scores from the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education • EGRA: Refers to test scores from Early Grade Reading Assessments.","","","","","","","","","Patrinos and Angrist (2018).  http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/390321538076747773/Global-Dataset-on-Education-Quality-A-Review-and-Update-2000-2019","","","","","","CC BY-4.0",
